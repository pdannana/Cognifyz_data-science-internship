The Data Science Internship at Cognifyz Technologies involves working on various levels of tasks, each designed to cater to different aspects of data science, including data exploration, preprocessing, geospatial analysis, descriptive analysis, and more. Below is a detailed description of each level and the tasks I completed.

### Level 1: Data Exploration and Preprocessing

#### Task 1: Data Exploration and Preprocessing
- **Objective**: Explore the dataset, identify the number of rows and columns, check for missing values, perform data type conversion if necessary, analyze the distribution of the target variable ("Aggregate rating"), and identify any class imbalances.
- **Tools Used**: Google Colab, Pandas, NumPy
- **Steps**:
  - Loaded the dataset and explored its structure.
  - Identified and handled missing values.
  - Converted data types where necessary.
  - Analyzed the distribution of the "Aggregate rating" variable.

#### Task 2: Descriptive Analysis
- **Objective**: Calculate basic statistical measures for numerical columns, explore the distribution of categorical variables, and identify the top cuisines and cities with the highest number of restaurants.
- **Tools Used**: Google Colab, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Steps**:
  - Calculated mean, median, standard deviation, etc.
  - Analyzed categorical variables like "Country Code," "City," and "Cuisines."
  - Identified top cuisines and cities with the highest number of restaurants.

#### Task 3: Geospatial Analysis
- **Objective**: Visualize the locations of restaurants on a map using latitude and longitude information, analyze the distribution of restaurants across different cities or countries, and determine if there is any correlation between the restaurant's location and its rating.
- **Tools Used**: Google Colab, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Geopandas
- **Steps**:
  - Visualized restaurant locations on a map.
  - Analyzed restaurant distribution across cities and countries.
  - Determined correlations between location (latitude and longitude) and restaurant ratings.

### Level 2: Advanced Analysis

#### Task 1: Table Booking and Online Delivery
- **Objective**: Determine the percentage of restaurants that offer table booking and online delivery, compare the average ratings of restaurants with table booking and those without, and analyze the availability of online delivery among restaurants with different price ranges.
- **Tools Used**: Google Colab, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Steps**:
  - Calculated the percentage of restaurants offering table booking and online delivery.
  - Compared average ratings based on the availability of table booking.
  - Analyzed online delivery availability across different price ranges.

#### Task 2: Price Range Analysis
- **Objective**: Determine the most common price range among all the restaurants, calculate the average rating for each price range, and identify the color that represents the highest average rating among different price ranges.
- **Tools Used**: Google Colab, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Steps**:
  - Identified the most common price range.
  - Calculated average ratings for each price range.
  - Analyzed the color associated with the highest average rating.

### Level 3: Predictive Modeling and Data Visualization

#### Task 1: Predictive Modeling
- **Objective**: Build a regression model to predict the aggregate rating of a restaurant based on available features, split the dataset into training and testing sets, evaluate the model's performance, and experiment with different algorithms.
- **Tools Used**: Google Colab, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Steps**:
  - Built and evaluated regression models.
  - Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
  - Experimented with linear regression, decision trees, and random forest algorithms.

#### Task 2: Data Visualization
- **Objective**: Create visualizations to represent the distribution of ratings using different charts, compare average ratings of different cuisines or cities, and visualize the relationship between various features and the target variable.
- **Tools Used**: Google Colab, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Steps**:
  - Created histograms, bar plots, and scatter plots.
  - Compared average ratings of different cuisines and cities.
  - Visualized relationships between features and ratings.

### Insights and Findings

- **City Clusters**: Restaurant businesses tend to cluster in certain urban centers and popular tourist destinations.
- **Rating Riddle**: Ratings vary significantly within the same location, highlighting the subjective nature of culinary experiences.
- **Geographic Influence**: Some countries and regions have higher average restaurant ratings, indicating cultural and culinary influences.
- **Indian Enigma**: India, with over 8,600 restaurants, stands out as a gastronomic powerhouse, surpassing even the US and UK in restaurant numbers.
